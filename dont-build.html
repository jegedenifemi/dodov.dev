          </div>

          <p>
            In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our
            custom design and had smooth animations and interactions. I looked
            at <a href="#" class="link">UIkit</a>, but I didn't pick it for two
            reasons:
          </p>

          <br />

          <ul>
            <li class="list_items">
              <div><p>It had its own opinion on design</p></div>
            </li>
            <li class="list_items">
              <div>
                <p>It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"</p>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <p>
            This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit,
            provide just the basic JavaScript functionality, allowing you to
            style and animate as you wish. I didn't find anything. So,
            naturally, I decided to
            <a href="#" class="link"> make my own thing.</a>

            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was
            working on and it was wonderful. I was able to make the code just
            right and implement just the features I need. I took some
            inspiration from UIkit, but stuck to my main idea.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided to
            refactor. But because I was developing that framework and
            simultaneously using it, I had to rework not only the framework, but
            the website as well. Apart from that, I was trying to make this work
            for as many use cases as I could. What if you use React? What if you
            don't? What if you use jQuery? What if you don't even know
            JavaScript that much?
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without
            realizing it, I had put myself in a position where I wanted to solve
            problems that don't yet exist and solve them perfectly. But I still
            believed that in the end, it'd be "worth it".
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one working
            on that website. Since it used my framework, I had to onboard new
            people with it. This meant that I had to write up a README, then
            documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we still had to
            clear up some stuff in Slack.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on the
            framework in parallel with the website to transition in work on the
            framework during the weekends and early mornings.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the
            habit of abandoning projects, so I was determined to at least boil
            the framework down to small organized JavaScript snippets that you
            could download via npm. But do I use
            <a href="#" class="link">Custom Elements</a> or even go simpler than
            that and use just ES6 classes?
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Recently, I started getting more and more into the React ecosystem.
            Late to the party, I know. I also started noticing more websites
            with <code> &lt;div id="__next"&gt;</code> or <code>__nuxt</code> or
            <code>___gatsby</code>. So no matter how I build my framework, it
            wouldn't work with the way most people build for the web. Since I
            want to start using these tools as well, my framework won't work for
            me either.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more attention to my
            health and well-being. I changed my eating and sleeping habits,
            started to exercise and stretch more, I even started reading books…
            This made the weekends and early mornings much more packed and
            valuable.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody really uses, but
            still represents a solid part of our workflow. What do I do? Well, I
            think I've learned some lessons in the past 3 years.
          </p>

          <h2>Code Doesn't Matter</h2>
          <p>
            Unless you're building software for aircraft or medical equipment,
            nobody really cares about your code, and neither should you.
            Especially in web development. At the end of the day, you want a
            bunch of boxes with text and images in them. You can have a hellish
            codebase and still get the job done. A perfect codebase doesn't
            exist. At least not for a very long time, in large projects, or with
            many people involved. Things will get messy and you should be ready
            to accept that.
          </p>

          <h2>Maintenance Is a Burden</h2>
          <p>
            Let's say you've built something and it works perfectly. That won't
            last long. Bugs will appear, new people will join and documentation
            will be needed, features will be requested. Who's going to handle
            that? If you're doing this as a side project, are you prepared to be
            distracted by these things while working? If not, are you prepared
            to do them in your free time?
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Even if people start contributing with pull requests and taking some
            of that load off of you, you'll still have to review and approve of
            what's going on.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Is Fine</h2>
          <p>
            If you find someone else who has done the work for you, use it.
            There might be things that you don't like, but compared to the
            hidden costs of maintaining something yourself, they won't matter.
            If that third-party code has been out for a long time, chances are
            that most common bugs and edge cases would have already been
            handled. Doing things yourself should be your last resort, because
            you'll slowly discover the same issues as well and waste time on
            solved problems.
          </p>

          <h2>Launch Early</h2>
          <p>
            On the off-chance that you really want or have to build something,
            launch it as soon as you can. As David Heinemeier Hansson said on
            <span class="link">episode "Launch Now" of the Rework podcast</span
            >:
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you're not uncomfortable by the time you're launching, <br />
              it's way too late.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <br />

          <p>
            I never really launched my side project. It wasn't "ready". At the
            same time, it became a bigger and bigger dependency in our main
            projects. That's an issue, because you're building on top of
            something that isn't validated by other people. If I had shared it,
            maybe people would have helped out and given ideas for improvements.
            Or, maybe people would have critiqued it and made me question
            whether it's valuable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And that's what I was most afraid of — that the project isn't
            valuable. But no matter how much effort you put into something, you
            still can't know for sure if it's valuable until other people give
            their own points of view. That's why it's better to launch as soon
            as possible:
          </p>

          <br />

          <ul>
            <li class="list_items">
              <div>
                <p>
                  If you've built something valuable, you'll get more
                  like-minded people to help you out with it
                </p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="list_items">
              <div>
                <p>
                  If you've built something pointless, you'll save time and
                  probably learn about new and better approaches
                </p>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <br />

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            I will archive my project. These problems have already been solved
            by many people, many times. We all know that
            <a href="#" class="link"
              >every day, a new JavaScript framework is born</a
            >. This happens because people like me think they've got the silver
            bullet and can solve a certain problem once and for all. But that's
            impossible and delusional. It's like that
            <a href="#" class="link">xkcd comic about standards</a>:
          </p>

          <img
            src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png"
            alt="xkcd comic about standards"
            id="img2"
          />
          <div id="modal2" class="modal2">
            <img
              src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png"
              alt="xkcd comic about standards"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            We should work on solving new problems, not existing ones. If you
            find an issue with someone else's code, report it or directly submit
            a pull request and fix it. Not just for yourself, but for everybody
            else! Your contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't create
            something new with its own set of problems.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It's impossible to build something entirely by yourself. At some
            point, your "pristine" code will have to interact with other
            people's "messy" code. Sure, you might not use third-party code on
            your website, but its existence still depends on it. The operating
            system it runs on is not built by you. The browser that your viewers
            use to see it is not built by you. The protocols that carry your
            data across the wire are not designed by you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>You will always depend on other people's work. Embrace that!</p>
